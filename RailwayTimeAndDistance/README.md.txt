# Rail Finder

Rail Finder is a backend-driven application designed to find train names, train times, and their arrival and departure schedules between stations. It utilizes Spring Boot for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, creating a seamless and dynamic user experience.

---

## Description
The **Rail Finder** project leverages Spring Boot's core functionalities, JPA internal methods, SQL, and Postman testing to build RESTful APIs, which are then consumed using JavaScript to fetch and display train data. This application is ideal for understanding train schedules and timings, making it a convenient tool for users looking for simple train-related queries.

This project marks a significant milestone as my first-ever software development project and demonstrates a strong foundation in full-stack development.

## Features
- Search for train names and timings between stations.
- View arrival and departure times of trains.
- RESTful API integration for dynamic data fetching.
- Backend tested using Postman.

## Technologies Used
**Backend:**
- Spring Boot framework
- Java
- SQL
- Java Persistence API (JPA)
- Postman (for API testing)

**Frontend:**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Run the Spring Boot application using your IDE or terminal.

Open the frontend files in a browser to access the interface.

Usage
Start the backend server by running the Spring Boot application.

Use the frontend interface to search for train names, schedules, and timings.

Observe dynamic data retrieval powered by RESTful APIs.

Special Acknowledgment
This project is dedicated to Ashwani Kumar, whose exceptional guidance in the Java Full Stack Developer batch enriched my understanding of Java, Spring Boot, SQL, and Postman testing principles.

Future Enhancements
Expand the train dataset for more comprehensive results.

Add user authentication for personalized features.

Integrate a database for persistent data storage.
